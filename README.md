# DeepEmail
DeepEmail is an opensource project which helps you with ready-made APIs to trigger emails in your application.
There are a number of reasons why you should consider DeepEmail over any other alternative:
# FREE 
Its opensource and hence free to use in anyway you want in your projects.
# SCALABLE:
Multithreaded design allows you to scale verically up by giving more number of threads in thread-pool. Needless to say, you can always scale horizontally and put a load balancer to balance your traffic.
# SECURE
DeepEmail allows you to send emails from any email-id you want and takes care of your password privacy by encrypting your password with triple-DES algorithm. Only encrypted passwords are allowed in JSON requests.
# PERFORMANCE
In case you want to send more number of emails per unit time, DeepEmail provides you with '/deepemail/trigger' API which doesn't wait for entire thread to finish execution and gets ready to accept more requests.
# UNIT-TESTED
With more than 90% code coverage, you get a sense of reliability. When you change anything specific to your needs, you can always run those unit tests to confirm nothing is breaking.
# PRODUCTION-READY CODE QUALITY
Attention has been given to write clean and maintainable code.
# SAVES TIME
Finally, the question is - why would you write code for something which has already been written, tried and tested? Save your precious time and use DeepEmail as your email service for your project.
